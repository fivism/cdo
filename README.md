# cdo
cdo - another minimalist todolist

The best feature is no features! Just a simple list that loads up a savefile and allows given entries to be deleted without a running state.

local savefile has a purposely-obfuscated byte order such that cheating on your todos or careless adding and deletion of tasks is *not* recommended.
