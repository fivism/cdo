# cdo
cdo - another minimal todolist

The best feature is no features! Just a list that loads up FIFO and allows given entries to be deleted. 

local savefile has a purposely-obfuscated byte order such that cheating on your todos or careless adding and deletion of tasks is not recommended.
 
a working prototype alpha for now


# TODO
- Add a splash of color
- Add a 0box celebratory message
- Add help flags
- Fix directory path for savefile
- Config for dropbox piggybacking
