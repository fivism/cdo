# cdo
cdo - another minimal todolist

cdo is the equivalent of a scrap of notebook paper that you need in front of you for 45 minutes or a day but not more.

The best feature is no features! Just a list that loads up FIFO and allows given entries to be deleted. 

Currently just a working alpha

# TODO
- Remove need for quotes (add all argv elements if valid) 
- Add a splash of color
- Add a 0box celebratory message
- Add help flags
- Fix directory path for savefile
- STop interpreting numbers first (course number triggers this)
