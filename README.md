# cdo
cdo - another minimal todolist

The best feature is no features! Just a simple FIFO list that loads up a savefile and allows given entries to be deleted without a running state.

local savefile has a purposely-obfuscated byte order such that cheating on your todos or careless adding and deletion of tasks is not recommended.
 
a working prototype alpha for now. Proudly released under the new [GLWT license](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL/blob/master/LICENSE).


# TODO
- [x] Add a splash of color [x]
- [] Add a 0box celebratory message
- [x] Add help flags 
- [] Fix directory path for savefile
- [] Config for dropbox piggybacking
